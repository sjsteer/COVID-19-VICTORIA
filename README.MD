# COVID-19 Victorian Scraper

This project aims to scrape COVID-19 data for Victoria, Australia every morning.
At some point, this project will be automatic so stay tuned.

Data is pulled daily from [COVID Live](https://covidlive.com.au/report/daily-cases/vic) every morning, around 11AM.

Here is an example of the plot generated:
